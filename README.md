## 🌟 Why Charge Scolaire?

Most school dashboards are just data tables. **Charge Scolaire** turns that data into actionable insights with a premium, app-like experience.

*   **📊 Omni-Dashboard**: Grades, homework, and schedule in one unified, clutter-free view.
*   **🔮 Predictive Analytics**: Powered by `Recharts` to visualize your academic trajectory and simulate future grades.
*   **⚡ Instant Interactions**: Built with `Framer Motion` for fluid, 60fps animations.
*   **🔐 Privacy First**: Your data stays yours. Secure connection via Supabase.

## 🛠️ The Stack

This project allows me to experiment with modern web graph and animation libraries.

*   **Frontend**: React + Vite (Fast HMR)
*   **Styling**: TailwindCSS (Utility-first)
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion
*   **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
